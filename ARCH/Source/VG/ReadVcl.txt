1. Overview
-----------
    VG Library contains a large number of different components and a few
function libraries. Library distrubuted with full source code and is 
compatible with Delphi 2, 3 and 4. 

    Library includes Russian (native), English and Spanish string resources.

    VG library contains a few components that reqires RX library to be 
installed. These components are optional. To use them you should install and 
compatible with RX library 2.30 up to 2.60.

    Unfortunately there is no help available.

2. Components
-------------
    Components are splitted into five parts: System, Controls, Explorer,
    Data Access, and Data Controls.

    TvgThread is the TThread wrapper.

    TMoneyString translates numeric values into their verbal representation.

    TDateTimeStorage and TCurrencyStorage components updates local settings
    internally used by your application.

    TFormLoader component simplifies merging forms into TWinControl descendents
    and usable for creating multi-sheet forms and user interfaces.

    TMSSCScript component wrapps Microsoft TScriptControl and enables you to
    write and execute Visual Basic and JavaScript scripts within your
    application.

    TTranslator component iterates through string-like properties of given
    instances allowing to translate them into another languages.

    TvgSplitter control has the same functionality as the standart TSplitter.

    TJustifyEdit is an obsolete control. See TClickEdit for details.

    TClickEdit looks like standart TEdit and enables to align editing text.
    It has optional button with bitmap at the right side.

    TTitler is a custom panel that shows scrolling text.

    TvgPageControl is a TPageControl descendent that has all properties of
    component released in Delphi 4. There is also TvgTabSheet control which
    supports ImageIndex property.

    TvgNoteBook is TNotebook descendent with 3D view.

    TvgTabSet is custom-draw TTabSet. It allows to orient tabs on all sides
    of control.

    TExplorerNodes descendents provides you with powerfull API of handling
    tree-like data structures.

    Explorer controls represent structure of TExplorerNodes in different
    ways. Library includes TExplorerTreeView, TExplorerListView,
    TExplorerListBox and TExplorerTreeCombo controls.

    TvgDatabase provides you with advanced transaction control for
    multithreaded applications. It allows easy programming of database
    locking during transactions for RDMs written in apartment or free
    threading model.

    TvgQuery extends functionality of TRxQuery (RX library). It automatically
    refreshes when params or macros are changed.

    TvgSQLScript has functionality as TSQLScript (RX library). It executes
    multiple SQL statements like original TSQLScript and has additional
    events. TvgSQLScript provides you with macro extensions of SQL like
    TRxQuery does.

    TvgUpdateScript is TUpdateObject descendent that enables to write
    multiple SQL statements while applying updates with cached updates
    mechanism.

    TFieldSource is the TFieldDataLink wrapper. It "filters" data events
    that send TDataSource on listed fields.

    TOpenTables manages list of open datasets. It counts references on
    dataset and closes it when dataset is no more needed.

    TBDEDataSetHook reassign dataset events to allow splitting buisness-logic 
    into parts.

    TDBConverter, TBDEConverter provides you with codeless techinque of
    converting old databases into databases with new structure.

    TvgDBGrid is the same as TRxDBGrid (RX library) and has miscelaneous
    visual enhancements: row colors.

    TvgQuickSearch and TRxQuickSearch provides incremental search in TDBGrid.
    Pressing Ctrl+C user can copy contents of grid into Clipboard.

    TvgDBLookupCombo is the same as TRxDBLookupCombo. It has optional small
    button which can be pressed to show modal dialogs with data dictionaries
    or to perform other actions.

    TvgDBTreeView, TvgDBTreeCombo components navigates through tree-like
    datasets.

    TvgDBMenu is TDBNavigator in the form of popup menu.

    TDBRadioButton is just radio button that doesn't require TDBRadioGroup.

    TvgWordPrint is a powerfull component family that provides you with
    open report system for Microsoft Word. Family includes full-functional
    components that works with data of BDE and DBClient datasets.

4. Installation
---------------
    1. Delphi 4.
    Library includes six design-time packages: vgDVCL4, vgDDB4, vgDMID4, 
    vgDRXDB4, vgMID24, vgDWP4.

    If you don't have Client/Server Delphi editon comment out MIDAS conditional 
    define in the VG.INC include file.

    Compile and install packages vgDVCL4, vgDDB4, vgDMID4, vgDWP4.

    If you have RX library 2.50 or higher compile and install package vgDRXDB4.

    If you have both Client/Server Delphi edition and RX library 2.50 or higher 
    compile and install vgMID24 .    

    Add path to compiled dcu files to Library Path string.

    2. Delphi 3.
    Perform steps listed above for packages vgDVCL, vgDDB, vgDMID, 
    vgDRXDB, vgMID2, vgDWP.

    3. Delphi 2.

    In "Install components" choose vgVCLRg, vgDBRg, vgWPReg, vgRXDBRg (if RX
    library 2.30 or higher already installed).  

5. Notes
--------
   1. VG library requires next files in the system path:
     MSVCRT.DLL
     vgLZSS32.DLL
     vgI0.DLL

   2. If RX library is 2.40 or higher make sure that key RX240 is defined in
   include file VG.INC.

   3. Uncomment MIDAS condition in include file VG.INC if have client/server 
   Delphi editon and VG Midas Library on search path.

   4. DBCLIENT.DLL must be version 5.00 or higher.

   5. Don't save packages within Delphi IDE to prevent conditional defines
   corruption.

   6. TTranslator, TMSSCScript components are betas.

   7. Microsoft Script Control OCX is required to use TMSSCScript.
   It is available at http://www.microsoft.com/scripting.
